/*A boy is playing with a clock, and initially, the clock points at 12:00. He rotates the hour hand by a given angle, x degrees. Your task is to classify the resulting angle formed between the hour hand and the minute hand based on the following rules:

Acute Angle: An angle less than 90 degrees.
Right Angle: An angle exactly equal to 90 degrees.
Obtuse Angle: An angle between 90 degrees and 180 degrees.
Straight Angle: An angle exactly equal to 180 degrees.
Reflex Angle: An angle greater than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees.
Full Rotation: An angle exactly equal to 360 degrees.
Write a program to determine the type of angle formed between the hour hand and minute hand.

Note:

The minute hand does not move when the hour hand is rotated. Only the hour hand rotation is considered.
The boy may rotate the hour hand more than 1 rotation.
If the boy decides not to rotate the hour hand at all, then assume the result as Acute Angle.
Input Format

A single integer representing the angle x

Constraints

0 ≤ x ≤ 10^6

Output Format

Print the classification of the angle in terms of Acute Angle, Right Angle, Obtuse Angle, Straight Angle, Reflex Angle, or Full Rotation.*/
