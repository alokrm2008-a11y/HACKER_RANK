/*In the ancient kingdom of Zabiria, there exists a magical gate known as the Prime Gate.

The gate reacts differently depending on the nature of the number it receives:

It opens when given a Prime number
It remains closed when given a Composite number
It stays inactive when given a number that is neither Prime nor Composite
A young programmer Omkar has been chosen to guard the gate. Every day, the gate provides a natural number.
Omkar must determine the correct nature of the number so the gate behaves accordingly.

Your task is to help Omkar by writing a program that checks whether the given number is Prime, Composite, or Neither.

Input Format

A single line containing one natural number N.

Constraints

-10^9 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 10^9
Output Format

Print Prime, if the number is prime
Print Composite, if the number is composite
Print None, if the number is neither prime nor composite*/
