/*Write a program to generate the first n terms of an Arithmetic Progression (AP). The first term a and the common difference d are provided.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of terms to generate.
The second line contains two integers a and d, the first term and the common difference, respectively.
Constraints

0 ≤ n ≤ 1000
-1000 ≤ a ≤ 1000
-1000 ≤ d ≤ 1000
Output Format

Print the first n terms of the AP in a single line, separated by spaces..*/
